# al-qasida

Welcome! This is the official repo for AL-QASIDA (Robinson et al., 2025), 
the first comprehensive evaluation for LLM dialectal Arabic proficiency, presented in 
this paper: 
[AL-QASIDA: **A**nalyzing **L**LM **Q**uality and **A**ccuracy **S**ystematically **i**n **D**ialectal **A**rabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04193)

⚠️ Note this repo has been updated to be used for *dev* by default, rather than testing (for the [AMIYA](https://sites.google.com/view/vardial-2026/shared-tasks) shared task)

## Current to-dos 

To update soon:
- 🚧 I noticed an issue that the `pre_humeval` outputs for MT tasks are not getting written properly without use of `eval/correct_scores.py`, due to absense of `llm_outputs/**/*samples*` files. Need to address this ASAP.
- 🚧 Need to rename hehe --> cohere, TVD --> ADI2
- 🚧 Make tutorial video in Arabic

## Tutorial video

See our video tutorial for running AL-QASIDA [here](https://youtu.be/_BVEitNmtCI). Or feel free to go through the instructions at your own pace. 

## Instructions

To set up the environment, run:

```
bash setup.sh
```

For instructions on running AL-QASIDA, refer to 

1. [`data_processing/README.md`](data_processing/README.md)
2. [`eval/README.md`](eval/README.md)
3. [`humevals/README.md`](humevals/README.md)

in that order. 

You could also skip to step #3 if you don't want to run AL-QASIDA on your own model. 
The results for the models we evaluated in our paper are already in `llm_outputs`.

If you have any questions or difficulty running our evaluation, please feel free to raise issues or
